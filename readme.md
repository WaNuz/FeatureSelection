# Objective: To test out two feature selection algorithms and then use both Decision trees, and K-Nearest neighbour to see which feature selection had higher accuracy. 

## Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/fanbyprinciple/iot-device-identification 
A list of captured packets from different IOT devices. 

## Scope: To measure the accuracy of the algorithm and determine which feature selection algorithm has higher accuracy. Results only includes accuracy percentage, ROC, AUC, and confusion matrix. 

## Problems thus far

- Using an appropriate feature selection algorithm to identifying the columns that matter (Chi-squared and mutual information)
- Find out if the way I used OutputCodeClassifier to normalise the y column into 0s and 1s for classification is correc or not. 
- better visualisation of the values.
- Implement Deecision trees and k-nearest neighbour.
